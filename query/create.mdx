Queries serve as the foundation of Viasheets, allowing you to extract data directly into Google Sheets. A **query** empowers you to choose the specific data you wish to extract from a source and seamlessly integrate it into a spreadsheet.

After you have crafted and executed a query, you will have the opportunity to save it, allowing you to rerun the query at a later time.

## Steps
1. Create or go to a Google Sheet that exists.
2. Click on **Extensions** > **Viasheets** > **Launch Viasheets**.
3. Wait for the sidebar to load.
4. Select your organization.

6. Give your query a name, Select the Source you want to pull from, and the Source API you want to get data from. If you have multiple sources connected, you need to click on the "Click Here" text underneath the "Select Source API" dropdown.

## FAQ
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between 'Add Source Data to Spreadsheet' and 'Create Query?'">
  Clicking **Add Source Data to Spreadsheet** will add in the data from the Source & Source API directly into the Google Sheet. In some cases (I.e. Plaid Transactions), we store a cursor which keeps tracks of the rows we've already added so that there are no duplicates. By clicking this, you pull data into the spreadsheet and we store a cursor for future use. Once you click on "Create Query", the next time you run the query, it will only add rows that we have not added before.

  If you click on **Create Query** before clicking **Add Source Data to Spreadsheet** we do not store the cursor and so the next time you pull in data from a source, it will add all transactions.
