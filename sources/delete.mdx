Removing a source on Viasheets is a straightforward process that can be completed directly from the dashboard. Since Viasheets does not retain any source data on our servers or database, the source deletion procedure is uncomplicated, ensuring that your data remains secure unless accessed through your own Google Sheet, where the data resides.

## Steps
1. Navigate to the [Viasheets Dashboard](https://dash.viasheets.com/dashboard)
2. Locate and click on the Connect button (the wording may vary depending on the source).
3. If multiple sources are connected, you will find an option to delete the desired source. If an API key is required, you can simply replace it with a random string for deletion.
